      <description>Between writing up my thesis, applying to jobs hire me! I’m quite good at programming, and the ongoing pandemic, I don’t really have time to write full blogposts. I have however decided to brush up my python skills and dive headfirst into Julia. As such, I like to answer the toy problems posted at fivethirtyeight’s riddler weekly. These will likely be even a few weeks late but it motivates me to tend to the blog and keep up my programming.</description>

In Riddler City, the city streets follow a grid layout, running north-south and east-west. You’re driving north when you decide to play a little game. Every time you reach an intersection, you randomly turn left or right, each with a 50 percent chance.
After driving through 10 intersections, what is the probability that you are still driving north?</description>

      <description>Every Tuesday, the R4DataScience community posts a dataset online as part of #TidyTuesday as practice wrangling and modelling data. For the week of 5th May 2020, the dataset concerned the video game Animal Crossing.
IntroRadiohead - How I Made My Millions
I don’t play Animal Crossing (unfortunately Nintendo Switches sold out as the UK went into lockdown), but it seems that everyone around me does so I’ve become fascinated by how it has created almost a surrogate life for people, performing manual tasks to pay off loans to Tom Nook, the nefarious bankster of the player’s island.</description>

      <description>I wrote this one pretty quickly compared to part 1 (which goes much deeper into mathematical concepts), and only realized after how much of a similarity it has to many of Ben Torvaney’s posts on the subject. This probably isn’t a coincidence given how much I’ve used his work previously in posts on this blog. Any imitation here is meant as flattery. The purpose of this post is really as a bridge between what I really want to write about- the maths behind the models in part 1, and extensions of these models into other distribution in parts 3-n so it might be a little derivative of stuff written elsewhere.</description>

      <description>written during lockdown so while I think it adds some value (and is useful to organise my thoughts on the paper for my own work on football) there are probably mistakes. E.g. the C++ code is still pretty inefficient and could well be improved and I’ve surely confused some maths concepts. To be honest, the post is just an excuse to practice writing LaTeX maths and some C++. Let me know my errors and I’ll correct</description>

      <description>One of the most consistent fonts of posts on this blog is The Guardian’s football trivia page The Knowledge. A particular reason for this is that the small contained questions lend themselves to small blogposts that I can turn around in an hour or two, as opposed to being endlessly redrafted until I lose interest.
However, I still sometimes don’t quite get round to finishing some of these posts, or have trouble justifying a blog post on a very small and ‘trivial’ answer to a question.</description>

      <description>I’m extremely biased, but to me, one of the real success* stories in neuroscience over the last (just over) two decades has been in studying reward signals. Since the seminal 1997 paper, a lot of work has gone into figuring out how the brain assigns value to outcomes.
*ugh, maybe. This isn’t a blog post about that
My PhD project looks at novel ways of eliciting valuation behaviour to study these signals, but as a key part of the modelling involved in this work, it’s important to get a handle on reinforcement learning.</description>

      <description>In my free time away from PhD and data science work, I (used to) enjoy rowing. Aside from obvious benefits like socialising, providing a (very intense) workout, seeing the outdoors at least a few times a week… there are really two things that I love(d) about rowing:
It’s the sport that is closest to a simple engineering problem. Going fast basically boils down to how in time and how hard you can get 1-8 guys to move an oar through the water.</description>

      <description>For a recent blogpost, I required data on the ELO ratings of national football teams over time. Such a list exists online at eloratings.net and so in theory this was just a simple task for rvest to read the html pages on that site and then fish out the data I wanted. However, while this works for the static websites which make up the vast majority of sites containing tables of data, it struggles with websites that use JavaScript to dynamically generate pages.</description>

      <description>For anyone watching football, being able to predict matches is a key aspect of the hobby. Whether explicitly (e.g. when betting on matches, or deciding on recruitment for an upcoming season), or more implicitly when discussing favourites to win the league in the pub, almost all discussion of the sport on some level require predictions about some set of upcoming games.
The first step of prediction is some form of quantification of ability.</description>

      <description>When studying why people make the economic choices they do, we need some way of quantifying the value to the person of the offered choices. For instance, when deciding whether to ride to my office by bike or instead catch the bus, there are myriad factors that my brain feeds into an equation to get two values:
the utility of taking the busthe utility of riding my bikeFor instance, if it looks like it might rain, I’m more likely to take the bus as getting soaked reduces the utility of cycling to work.</description>

      <description>Over the last few years since I started coding I’d always been interested in how data science could help predict football results/ identify footballing talents, and just generally ‘solve’ football.
One of the major problems with analysing football had been the availability of data. Though there’s a lot of great published stuff freely available to read, a lot of the cutting edge work revolves around advanced metrics, such as expected goals, which it’s hard to get the data for.</description>

This week, the data comes in the form of a massive corpus of every tweet using the #rstats hashtag, curated by rtweet package creator Mike Kearney.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I went on the first pub crawl I’d been on in years around my city of Cambridge. Around the same time I had also been visiting 4 very good pubs within ~200m of each other tucked away in a quiet neighbourhood of the town. Together, I wondered if it was possible with freely avaiable data to plan an optimal pub crawl around any town/area of the UK, and also, if it would be feasbile to visit every pub within the city in a single day if travelling optimally.</description>

      <description>Whilst getting some work done browsing twitter at work today, I came across this tweet from the always excellent John Burn-Murdoch on the scourge of heatmaps. What’s most frustrating about these maps is that ggplot2 (which is underrated as mapping software, especially when combined with packages like sf in R) makes it super easy to create this bland, uninformative maps.
For instance, lets load some mapping libraries
library(tidyverse)library(sf)library(rgdal)For this blog I’m going to use data of bus stops in London, because there’s an absolute ton of them and because I love the London Datastore and it was the first public, heavy, point data file I came across.</description>

      <description>Recently, I’d seen two tweets with stunning examples of maps by Paul Campbell here and (taken inspiration from the first) by Imer Muhović here.
The basic idea of the dot chloropleths is to visualise not only the location clustering of each variable but the number of observations (something traditional ‘filled’ chloropleths don’t do). More importantly than this, the maps also just look really really cool.
I had a spare few minutes during work on Friday which I tidied up into a package to calculate the random position of dots for such maps which can be found on my github.</description>
