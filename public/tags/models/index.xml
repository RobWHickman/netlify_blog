      <description>For anyone watching football, being able to predict matches is a key aspect of the hobby.

      <description>When studying why people make the economic choices they do, we need some way of quantifying the value to the person of the offered choices.

the utility of taking the busthe utility of riding my bikeFor instance, if it looks like it might rain, I’m more likely to take the bus as getting soaked reduces the utility of cycling to work.</description>
