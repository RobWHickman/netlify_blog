      <description>The first question this week concerns players scoring on (or nearest to) every day of the year
Has any player played/or even scored on every date in a calendar year. What’s the nearest anyone has come?— David Thomson (@thomsonionioni) January 29, 2019Getting the data for this is the main problem. The best (free) source I tend to use is transfermarkt.com, but data there becomes less reliable from before 2000 (and only has a few years of data from more obscure years where I could believe some players are banging in goals for fun).</description>

      <title>Planning a Pub Crawl Using R</title>

      <description>A few weeks ago I went on the first pub crawl I’d been on in years around my city of Cambridge. Around the same time I had also been visiting 4 very good pubs within ~200m of each other tucked away in a quiet neighbourhood of the town. Together, I wondered if it was possible with freely avaiable data to plan an optimal pub crawl around any town/area of the UK, and also, if it would be feasbile to visit every pub within the city in a single day if travelling optimally.</description>
