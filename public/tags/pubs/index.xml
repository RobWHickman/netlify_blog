      <description>A few weeks ago I went on the first pub crawl Iâ€™d been on in years around my city of Cambridge. Around the same time I had also been visiting 4 very good pubs within ~200m of each other tucked away in a quiet neighbourhood of the town. Together, I wondered if it was possible with freely avaiable data to plan an optimal pub crawl around any town/area of the UK, and also, if it would be feasbile to visit every pub within the city in a single day if travelling optimally.</description>
