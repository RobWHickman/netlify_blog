      <description>For anyone watching football, being able to predict matches is a key aspect of the hobby. Whether explicitly (e.g. when betting on matches, or deciding on recruitment for an upcoming season), or more implicitly when discussing favourites to win the league in the pub, almost all discussion of the sport on some level require predictions about some set of upcoming games.
The first step of prediction is some form of quantification of ability.</description>

      <description>In what is becoming a repeated series, I enjoy answering trivia questions from The Guardian’s The Knowledge football trivia column.
There’s a few questions that built up that seemed amenable to coding answers so I’ve taken a stab at them here

      <description>Every so often a question on The Guardian’s The Knowledge football trivia section piques my interest and is amenable to analysis using R. Previously, I looked at club name suffixes and young World Cup winners last August. This week (give or take), a question posed on twitter caught my attention:
@TheKnowledge_GU was just chatting to some colleagues in the kitchen at work about why Essex doesn&#39;t have many big football clubs and it got me thinking.</description>

      <description>Over the last few years since I started coding I’d always been interested in how data science could help predict football results/ identify footballing talents, and just generally ‘solve’ football.
One of the major problems with analysing football had been the availability of data. Though there’s a lot of great published stuff freely available to read, a lot of the cutting edge work revolves around advanced metrics, such as expected goals, which it’s hard to get the data for.</description>

      <description>The Guardian publish a weekly set of questions and answers on a variety of football minutiae at The Knowledge. Forutnately, some of these are extremely tractable using R, so I thought I’d have a go at working through the archives to see if I can shed light on any of the questions.

      <description>Recently, a Yorkshire national football team appeared in a league of national teams for stateless people. This got me wondering how the historic counties of the UK would do at the world cup. Could any of them compete with full international teams?
I published the complete code for that article on this blog this week. However, one question which I kept being asked was how a ‘All of the UK’ team would do (i.</description>
