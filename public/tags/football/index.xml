      <title>An Introduction to Modelling Soccer Matches in R (part 2)</title>

      <description>I wrote this one pretty quickly compared to part 1 (which goes much deeper into mathematical concepts), and only realized after how much of a similarity it has to many of Ben Torvaney’s posts on the subject. This probably isn’t a coincidence given how much I’ve used his work previously in posts on this blog. Any imitation here is meant as flattery. The purpose of this post is really as a bridge between what I really want to write about- the maths behind the models in part 1, and extensions of these models into other distribution in parts 3-n so it might be a little derivative of stuff written elsewhere.</description>

      <description>written during lockdown so while I think it adds some value (and is useful to organise my thoughts on the paper for my own work on football) there are probably mistakes. E.g. the C++ code is still pretty inefficient and could well be improved and I’ve surely confused some maths concepts. To be honest, the post is just an excuse to practice writing LaTeX maths and some C++. Let me know my errors and I’ll correct</description>

      <description>generally as I have less and less time to waste on meaningless football stats I get halfway through a post and abandon it. To remedy this, I want to start pushing out posts that give a reasonable half-guess at an answer within an hour or so without needing to really check my working or write good prose. This is the third of these
For this weeks question, I’m stealing straight from the source of most of my posts, The Knowledge column at The Guardian:What is the shortest total distance a club has had to travel in a Champions League winning campaign?</description>

      <description>One of the most consistent fonts of posts on this blog is The Guardian’s football trivia page The Knowledge. A particular reason for this is that the small contained questions lend themselves to small blogposts that I can turn around in an hour or two, as opposed to being endlessly redrafted until I lose interest.
However, I still sometimes don’t quite get round to finishing some of these posts, or have trouble justifying a blog post on a very small and ‘trivial’ answer to a question.</description>

      <description>In 2018, after watching the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_CONIFA_World_Football_Cup&#34;&gt;CONIFA World Cup&lt;/a&gt; final live, I wondered if an Independent Yorkshire could win the FIFA World Cup. This resulted in a few blogposts that were turned into an article in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.citymetric.com/horizons/football-could-independent-yorkshire-win-world-cup-3961&#34;&gt;Citymetric magazine&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>In Summer 2019, I won the chance to explore a hypothesis in football analytics using data from &lt;a href=&#34;https://statsbomb.com/conference/&#34;&gt;Statsbomb&lt;/a&gt;. My final project looked at Markov chain models of possession value in football, and considering how to incorporate defensive risk into such models.</description>

      <description>For a recent blogpost, I required data on the ELO ratings of national football teams over time. Such a list exists online at eloratings.net and so in theory this was just a simple task for rvest to read the html pages on that site and then fish out the data I wanted. However, while this works for the static websites which make up the vast majority of sites containing tables of data, it struggles with websites that use JavaScript to dynamically generate pages.</description>

      <description>Most Wednesday’s I enjoy reading The Knowledge blog on the Guardian’s website and reading the football trivia therein. When time (and questions) allow, I like to answer some of the questions posed, example of which are here, here, and here.
League of NationsThe first question comes from
Which player had the nationality with the lowest FIFA World Ranking at the time of him winning the Premier League?— The Tin Boonie (@TheTinBoonie) June 18, 2019a similar question is also answered in this weeks column:</description>

      <description>For anyone watching football, being able to predict matches is a key aspect of the hobby. Whether explicitly (e.g. when betting on matches, or deciding on recruitment for an upcoming season), or more implicitly when discussing favourites to win the league in the pub, almost all discussion of the sport on some level require predictions about some set of upcoming games.
The first step of prediction is some form of quantification of ability.</description>

      <description>In what is becoming a repeated series, I enjoy answering trivia questions from The Guardian’s The Knowledge football trivia column.
There’s a few questions that built up that seemed amenable to coding answers so I’ve taken a stab at them here

      <description>Every so often a question on The Guardian’s The Knowledge football trivia section piques my interest and is amenable to analysis using R. Previously, I looked at club name suffixes and young World Cup winners last August. This week (give or take), a question posed on twitter caught my attention:
@TheKnowledge_GU was just chatting to some colleagues in the kitchen at work about why Essex doesn&#39;t have many big football clubs and it got me thinking.</description>

      <description>Over the last few years since I started coding I’d always been interested in how data science could help predict football results/ identify footballing talents, and just generally ‘solve’ football.
One of the major problems with analysing football had been the availability of data. Though there’s a lot of great published stuff freely available to read, a lot of the cutting edge work revolves around advanced metrics, such as expected goals, which it’s hard to get the data for.</description>

      <description>The Guardian publish a weekly set of questions and answers on a variety of football minutiae at The Knowledge. Forutnately, some of these are extremely tractable using R, so I thought I’d have a go at working through the archives to see if I can shed light on any of the questions.
