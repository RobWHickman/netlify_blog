      <description>Riddler ClassicIn my spare time I enjoy solving 538’s The Riddler column. This week I had a spare few hours waiting for the Superbowl to start and decided to code up a solution to the latest problem to keep me busy.
The question revolves around a card game in which whatever choice a player makes, they are likely to lose to a con artist. Formally this is phrased as:</description>

      <description>Every so often a question on The Guardian’s The Knowledge football trivia section piques my interest and is amenable to analysis using R. Previously, I looked at club name suffixes and young World Cup winners last August. This week (give or take), a question posed on twitter caught my attention:
@TheKnowledge_GU was just chatting to some colleagues in the kitchen at work about why Essex doesn&#39;t have many big football clubs and it got me thinking.</description>

      <description>The Guardian publish a weekly set of questions and answers on a variety of football minutiae at The Knowledge. Forutnately, some of these are extremely tractable using R, so I thought I’d have a go at working through the archives to see if I can shed light on any of the questions.

      <description>Recently, a Yorkshire national football team appeared in a league of national teams for stateless people. This got me wondering how the historic counties of the UK would do at the world cup. Could any of them compete with full international teams?
I published the complete code for that article on this blog this week. However, one question which I kept being asked was how a ‘All of the UK’ team would do (i.</description>

This is the complete script for an short article I wrote for CityMetric on the topic. It’s split over 5 separate parts and is pretty hefty but contains pretty much everything you need to clone the article.</description>

      <description>I’ve been looking for small programming problems to practice on while running experiments. One such source is Fivethirtyeight’s Riddler column which posts conundrums weekly. This week one problem focus on one of life’s universal problems: how many urinals are needed in any bathroom for all patrons to use it without awkwardness.
Formally this is phrased as:
Some number, N, of people need to pee, and there is some number, M, of urinals in a row in a men’s room.</description>

      <description>Finally gotten around to using my blogdown website!
Feels like a fairly good place to publicise a small package to plot chess games using only the pgn using ggplot2 in R which can be found here
To copy the readme mini-vignette provides a nice overview of the uber-function which goes from pgn -&amp;gt; gif.
As in the README massive thanks and inspiration to Joshua Kunst and his rchess package which I failed to get going on my laptop and decided to try my arm at writing something from scratch.</description>
