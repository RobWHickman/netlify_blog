# Biography

I'm currently a third year PhD Student in the lab of Wolfram Schultz at the University of Cambridge. I study decision making in simple economic tasks in non-human primates, and in my spare time enjoy practising my coding- mostly in R. This website serves as a hub for small pieces of work relating to this.

Currently looking for jobs related to analytics/ data science, starting within the next ~3 months. My CV is listed at the top.
