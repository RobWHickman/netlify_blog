# Biography

I'm currently a first year PhD Student in the lab of Wolfram Schultz at the University of Cambridge. I study decision making in simple economic tasks in non-human primates, and in my spare time enjoy practising my coding- mostly in R- and writing about neuroscience and AI. This website serves as a hub for small pieces of work relating to both those interests.
