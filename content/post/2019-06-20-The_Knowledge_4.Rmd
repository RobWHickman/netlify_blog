Most wednesday's I enjoy reading [The Knowledge](https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theknowledge) blog on the Guardian's website and reading the football trivia therein. When time (and questions) allow, I like to answer some of the questions posed, example of which are [here](http://www.robert-hickman.eu/post/the-knowledge-4th-august-2018/), [here](http://www.robert-hickman.eu/post/counties_league_points/), and [here](http://www.robert-hickman.eu/post/the-knowledge-7th-february-2019/).

# League of Nations

The first question comes from

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Which player had the nationality with the lowest FIFA World Ranking at the time of him winning the Premier League?</p>&mdash; The Tin Boonie (@TheTinBoonie) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheTinBoonie/status/1140936272862691328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 18, 2019</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

a similar question is also answered in thi weeks column:

'*“Fulham defender Zesh Rehman made his debut for Pakistan, who are ranked 168 by Fifa. Is that the lowest-ranked country a Premier League player has played for?”* wondered Zulfiqar Shah in January 2006.'

I thought I'd answer both of these using R.

First some libraries we'll need, and also set a seed for reproducibility.

```{r libraries, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(rvest)

set.seed(3459)
```

The first thing we need to answer these is the nationality of EPL players. For this two good sources are [transfermarkt.co.uk](https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/) and [11v11.com](https://www.11v11.com/). I'm going to opt for the later, just because the tables are a little easier to scrape.

To start, we need to get the links to every team to have competed in the premier league

```{r epl_teams, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# get years of EPL seasons
years <- 1993:2019
# base url we'll scrape from
base_url <- "https://www.11v11.com"

# cat together
tables <- paste0(base_url, "/league-tables/premier-league/01-june-", years)

competing_teams <- tables %>%
  # get a list of the links to every teams squad page
  map(., function(x) {
    x %>%
      read_html() %>%
      html_nodes("#table-league > tbody:nth-child(2) > tr > td:nth-child(2) > a:nth-child(1)") %>%
      html_attr("href") %>%
      # paste into working link for year and competition (EPL)
      paste0(base_url, ., "tab/players/season/", gsub(".*01-june-", "", x), "/comp/1/")
  }) %>%
  unlist()

head(competing_teams, n = 5)

```

We can then scrape the squads for these teams in that specific season. We want the players, their nationality and also the number of appearances they made in the league that season

```{r get_squads, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
squads <- competing_teams %>%
  # get the players/appearances/nationalities
  map_df(., function(y) {
    # read once to save server calls
    read <- y %>%
      read_html() 
    
    # get the squad info
    squad <- read %>%
      html_nodes(".squad") %>%
      html_table(fill = TRUE) %>%
      as.data.frame() %>%
      # get rid of rows without player info
      filter(!is.na(Player))
    
    # get the listed nationalities
    flags <- read %>%
      html_nodes(".squad > tbody:nth-child(2) > tr > td:nth-child(3)")
    
    # from here get the actual nationalities per player
    nations <- flags %>%
      html_nodes("img") %>%
      html_attr("title")
    
    # these might mismatch in length
    # in which case append NA
    if(length(flags) != length(nations)) {
      missing <- which(!grepl("img", flags))
      
      nations <- c(nations[1:(missing-1)], NA, nations[missing:length(nations)])
    }
    
    # mutate nationality and team and season
    squad %>%
      mutate(nation = nations,
             year = gsub(".*season\\/", "", gsub("\\/comp.*", "", y)),
             team = gsub("\\/tab\\/players.*", "", gsub(".*teams\\/", "", y))) %>%
      # select useful appearance information
      select(player = Player, position = Position,
             appearances = A, sub_appearances = S, 
             nation, year, team)
  }) %>%
  # manually add in some missing nationalities
  mutate(nation = case_when(
    grepl("Steffen Karl", player) ~ "Germany",
    grepl("Marc Muniesa", player) ~ "Spain",
    grepl("Oriol Romeu", player) ~ "Spain",
    grepl("Aleix García", player) ~ "Spain",
    grepl("Martín Montoya", player) ~ "Spain",
    TRUE ~ nation
  ))

head(squads, n = 10)

```

```{r load_squads, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
squads <- readRDS("C:/Users/rob-getty/Desktop/squads.rds")
```

To answer the question as asked, we'd want historical [FIFA ranking](https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/) data. While it does exist going back to 2007, I'd prefer to have the full dataset back to 1993, and in any case, there are also [some problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Football_Elo_Ratings) with the historical calculation FIFA used for it's ratings.

Instead, I'm going to copy [eloratings.net](http://www.eloratings.net/) which calculated the ranking based on an ELO system as explained [here](http://www.eloratings.net/about).

It's fairly easy to calculate this over time given a df of historical international, which can be found at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017/downloads/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017.zip/42). 

This can be downloaded and extracted with a free account, giving a 40451 row data frame, each with the details of one international football match.

```{r international_df, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# load a df of international results
# from https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017/downloads/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017.zip/42
international_results <- readRDS("../../static/files/international_results.rds")

head(international_results)
```

Before calculating the elo ratings adjustment for each match, we need to initialise the parameters for each match (see [here](http://www.eloratings.net/about)). Unfortunately, the data does not include the context of each match, so we can't adjust for match importance (a World Cup final should be taken more seriously than a friendly exhibition match), so I set the K parameter to 40 for each match. This will lead to discrepancies between my calculations and the 'official' eloratings.net rankings, but the gist at least should be the same

```{r munge_results, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# prepare results df for ELO modelling
international_results %<>%
  # select relevant columns
  select(date, home = home_team, away = away_team, hgoal = home_score, agoal = away_score, neutral) %>%
  # convert date to date format
  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>%
  # K = match importance
  # don't have competition data in this dataset so just set to 40
  mutate(K =  40) %>%
  # G = goal difference factor
  # takes into account how much a team is beaten by
  mutate(G = case_when(
    abs(hgoal-agoal) < 2 ~ 1,
    abs(hgoal-agoal) < 3 ~ 1.5,
    abs(hgoal-agoal) >= 3 ~ 1.75 + (abs(hgoal-agoal)-3)/8
  )) %>%
  # results = 1 for win and 0.5 for a draw
  mutate(result = case_when(
    hgoal > agoal ~ 1,
    hgoal < agoal ~ 0,
    hgoal == agoal ~ 0.5
  )) %>%
  # arrange by date so ELO can be updated sequentially
  arrange(date)

head(international_results)

```

We can then generate a function to calculate the ELO adjustment of each team which will take ratings from, and pass updated ratings to, a df of teams with their ELO rating. This data frame is also initialised below it

```{r set_up_ELO, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# function to calculate updated ELO ratings
calc_ELO <- function(date, home, away, K, G, result) {
  #get the difference in ratings
  hr <- team_ratings$rating[which(team_ratings$nation == home)]
  vr <- team_ratings$rating[which(team_ratings$nation == away)]
  dr <- vr - (hr + 100)
  
  # calculate expected results
  e_result <- 1/ ((10^(dr/400))+1)
  
  # calculate new ratings
  new_hr <- hr + ((K*G) * (result - e_result))
  new_vr <- vr + ((K*G) * ((1-result) - (1-e_result)))
  
  # pipe these back into a df of team ratings to sample from
  team_ratings$rating[which(team_ratings$nation == home)] <<- new_hr
  team_ratings$rating[which(team_ratings$nation == away)] <<- new_vr
  
  # return new ratings
  return(list(h_rating = new_hr, v_rating = new_vr))
}

# df of team ratings to keep updated ELOs
team_ratings <- international_results %>%
  # select date and teams
  select(date, home, away) %>%
  # melt
  gather(., "location", "nation", home, away) %>%
  select(-location) %>%
  arrange(date) %>%
  # set out unique teams with a rating of 1200 initially
  filter(!duplicated(nation)) %>%
  mutate(rating = 1200) %>%
  select(-date)

head(team_ratings)

```

The calc_ELO function is then ran rowwise using pmap_df, and the results bound columnwise onto the original data frame. For each of these small blog posts I like to try and learn one thing, and this was an improvement over the splitting of a data.frame and lapply-ing rows I used before. 

The ELO data is then melted and arranged, then filtered giving only the data from 1992 onwards (the formation of the premier league)

```{r calculate_national_elo, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
elo_data <- international_results %>%
  # select relevant variable
  # keep date so we know a teams ELO at specific date
  select(date, home, away, K, G, result) %>%
  # apply the calc_ELO function over rows of df
  bind_cols(pmap_df(., calc_ELO)) %>%
  # get rid of ELO parameters
  select(date, home, away, h_rating, v_rating) %>%
  # gather twice to get a long df of teams ratings after matches
  gather("location", "nation", -date, -h_rating, -v_rating) %>%
  gather("rating", "value", -date, -location, -nation) %>%
  # filter for home rating for teams at home and vice versa
  filter((location == "home" & rating == "h_rating") |
           (location == "away" & rating == "v_rating")) %>%
  select(date, nation, rating = value) %>%
  # we only care about ratings from August 1992
  filter(date > "1992-07-31")

```

To show how the ELO progresses over time we can randomly (though fixed via seeding at the start) select a few teams and plot this

```{r plot_teams_elo, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# randomly select countries who have max ratings > 1600
# otherwise too biases towards small, hard to judge, countries
teams <- elo_data %>%
  filter(rating > 1600) %>%
  .$nation %>%
  unique() %>%
  # select 5 teams
  .[sample(length(.), 5)]

# plot the elo over time for these countries
p1 <- elo_data %>%
  filter(nation %in% teams) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = rating, colour = nation, group = nation)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("skyblue", 
                                 "darkblue",
                                 "darkorange",
                                 "darkgreen",
                                 "red")) +
  theme_minimal()

# plot
plot(p1)
```

This passes the sanity check, with nations that have historically been better showing higher ELO ratings.

```{r}
url <- "C:/Users/rob-getty/Downloads/test2.htm"
links <- read_html(url) %>%
  html_nodes("div.ui-widget-content:nth-child(10) > div:nth-child(2) > a:nth-child(1)") %>%
  html_attr("href")

get_ratings <- function(link) {
  download.file(link, "./test.htm")
  dl_page <- file.path(getwd(), "test.htm")
  
  teams <- read_html(url) %>%
    html_nodes("div.ui-widget-content:nth-child(6) > div:nth-child(6)") %>%
    html_text()
}
```


Before we can join these two data series 

```{r check_nation_names, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
squad_teams <- unique(squads$nation)
rating_teams <- unique(elo_data$nation)

squad_teams[!squad_teams %in% rating_teams]
