<p>When studying why people make the economic choices they do, we need some way of quantifying the value to the person of the offered choices. For instance, when deciding whether to ride to my office by bike or instead catch the bus, there are myriad factors that my brain feeds into an equation to get two values:</p>
<ul>
<li>the utility of taking the bus</li>
<li>the utility of riding my bike</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, if it looks like it might rain, I’m more likely to take the bus as getting soaked reduces the utility of cycling to work. Conversely, if I glance at my watch and see that I’ve just missed a bus, the utility of taking the bus decreases as I don’t want to have to wait at the bus stop.</p>
<p>A frequent criticism of economics is that it assumes some <em>homo economicus</em> who will always choose that which maximizes this utility. Lets say the utilities of the two commute choices were only governed by p(rain) and e(wait time) respectively, then for a set probability of rain and expected wait time for the bus, I should always choose the same mode of transport. This is clearly not how humans (or any other animal) work and so for the last 50 years <a href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/~mcfadden/discrete/ch5.pdf">models of probabilistic choice</a> have been used instead.</p>
<p>The advantage to this is that by studying the % of times I decide to ride my bike into work vs catching the bus, for any set of parameters, it’s possible to derive the relative utility of that method of transportation. Then if a novel combination of rain/waiting comes up, it’s possible to predict the chance I will choose to ride my bike and the chance I will take the bus.</p>
<p>However, many of these models are fairly dense to approach without formal economic training, so I wanted to write a guide to deriving and using them in R. For the first post, I’ll consider a toy problem with a simple binary choice paradigm to get some of the basic ideas of random utility modelling down and hopefully build from that in later posts.</p>
<div id="example-problem" class="section level1">
<h1>Example Problem</h1>
<p>Summer is here and it’s time for the annual Behavioural Economics departmental picnic! Due to the collapsing global climate, this year is the hottest yet and you are eagerly anticipating sitting in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grantchester_Meadows">Granchester Meadows</a> with your favourite chilled soft drink and discussing your research.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you’ve been stuck in the office for most of the afternoon coding up your latest model and will arrive late. Due to the hot weather, most of the drinks have already been consumed and what’s left needs to be rationed. Luckily, you are all very rational behavioural economists who know that if you can find everyone’s utility for the two remaining drinks flavours, you can apportion them appropriately.</p>
<p>The two remaining drinks are <a href="https://media2.giphy.com/media/3oriffxcqE2syOd5Ty/giphy.gif">buzz cola</a> which comes in cans of 330ml which is very tasty, and <a href="https://comb.io/qbzoUv.gif">slurm</a> which comes in 2 litre bottles (which can be poured into any amount).</p>
<p>Someone quickly codes up a binary choice task where PhD students have to choose between 1,2, or 3 330ml cans of the desirable Buzz Cola, or some amount between 0 and 2000ml of the slightly less valued Slurm.</p>
<p>Having spent 10 minutes and 1800 trials doing the task your data looks like</p>

<p>We then need to solve your utilities of buzz cola and slurm. To do this we need to maximize the sum of the log likelihood of each choice you make.</p>
<p>Basically, for each trial when you are presented with x ml of buzz cola (the number of cans multiplied by 330ml per can) or y ml of slurm there are utility parameters (rho) for both of these which mean you have some total utility of offered buzz cola and total utility of offered slurm.</p>
<p>As a rational econ PhD student, you are pretty much always going to choose whichever of these utilities is greater. E.g:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#make up some utility parameters
buzz_cola_rho &lt;- 2
slurm_rho &lt;- 1

trial_utilities &lt;- trial_data %&gt;%
  #total utility of each offer is the amount * utility_parameter
  mutate(buzz_cola_utility = buzz_cola * 330 * buzz_cola_rho,
         slurm_utility = slurm * slurm_rho) %&gt;%
  #which utility is greater
  mutate(greater_utility = case_when(
    buzz_cola_utility &gt;= slurm_utility ~ &quot;buzz_cola&quot;,
    slurm_utility &gt; buzz_cola_utility ~ &quot;slurm&quot;
  )) %&gt;%
  #organise columns
  select(buzz_cola, buzz_cola_utility, 
         slurm, slurm_utility,
         greater_utility, choice)

<p>It’s clear to see that mostly the choices fall in line with these made up parameters. The two unexpected choices could be because of random participant mistakes, but is more likely due to our parameters not yet being optimized (more on that in a sec), or because even rational actors may sometimes choose something which seems to have less utility (e.g. when sampling, or as utilities change e.g. via satiety).</p>
<p>In the above example, given the relative utilities of the two offered drinks, it’s possible to work out the probability that the participant will choose either of them using a simple logit model. (for these formulae I’m copying the notation from <a href="https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/teaching/files/discrete.pdf">here</a>).</p>
<p>we have a binary model such that the choice of buzz cola can be represented by Y: <span class="math display">\[Y_{i} \in {0,1}\]</span></p>
<p>Where X is the difference in utility between the choices A (buzz cola) and B (slurm) on each trial, i</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[X_{i} = u(A_{i}) - u(B_{i})\]</span> using a logit model such that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\phi_{i} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\beta X_{i})}}\]</span> where beta is the temperature of the logit curve (i.e. the steepness).</p>
<p>The log probability of choosing A (buzz cola) is therefore the log(phi) when A is chosen, and log(1-phi) when B (slurm) is chosen. The Y/1-Y cancel the other term out as Y can either equal 1 (buzz cola choice) or 0 (slurm chosen).</p>
<p>We want to sum this over every trial and find the parameters for beta and the rho for both goods A (buzz cola) and B (slurm) which maximize this total sum</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathcal l_{n}(\beta|Y,X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_{i} log(\phi_{i}) + (1-Y_{i})log(1-\phi_{i})\]</span> In R this can be expressed as</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#function to calulate the log likelihood per trial over data

<p>We can start out with a parameter assuming the two utilities are equal</p>

<p>then we can use the optim function which will pass the parameter vector into the log likelihood function and iteratively change the values in the parameter vector until the greatest sum is returned. We’re looking for the greatest sum as the log likelihood per trial boils down to log(phi / 1-phi) where phi is between 0 and 1 and is greatest where the utility parameters make the post-hoc choice most clear. E.g. when choosing the buzz cola the log likelihood = log(phi) and we want to maximize phi.</p>
<p>Taking the log of x between 0 and 1 will give a negative number that approaches 0 as x approaches 1. So the total sum of log likelihood terms will approach 0 as the parameters maximize the phi term.</p>

<p>The final maximized value of -400 is still some way off 0 but seems to be the highest it will go.
