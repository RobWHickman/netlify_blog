<p>I’ve been looking for small programming problems to practice on while running experiments. One such source is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fast-can-you-type-a-million-letters/">Fivethirtyeight’s Riddler</a> column which posts conundrums weekly. This week one problem focus on one of life’s universal problems: how many urinals are needed in any bathroom for all patrons to use it without awkwardness.</p>
<p>Formally this is phrased as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some number, N, of people need to pee, and there is some number, M, of urinals in a row in a men’s room. The people always follow a rule for which urinal they select: The first person goes to one on either far end of the row, and the rest try to maximize the number of urinals between them and any other person. So the second person will go on the other far end, the third person in the middle, and so on. They continue to occupy the urinals until one person would have to go directly next to another person, at which point that person decides not to go at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s the minimum number, M, of urinals required to accommodate all the N people at the same time?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is perhaps easiest explained using the ‘urinal etiquette’ meme:</p>

<p>Luckily, this sort of problem is extremely tractable in R to get an estimate of the function for any 1:N people with a few simple loops:</p>

<p>We can then plot this. I decided to add a little flair to the plot using annotate_custom which is a nice little trick to spice up ggplots</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#load the libraries for plotting
library(ggplot2)
library(png)

#a nice png of a urinal I found online

  rasterGrob()

#plot the number of urinals needed for any n number of patrons
urinals_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = results_df, aes(x = n, y = urinals_required)) + 
  geom_point() +
  #mapply a function to paste the urinal image as an annotation to the graph
  #takes the x and y arguments from the ggplot aesthetic
  mapply(function(x, y, size) {
    annotation_custom(urinal_image,
                      xmin = x - size, xmax = x + size, 
                      ymin = y - size, ymax = y + size) },
    x = results_df$n, y = results_df$urinals_required, size = 7) +
  #labelling and etc.

  ggtitle(&quot;How many urinals are needed for any n number of socially awkward urinators&quot;,

  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = &#39;lightblue&#39;))

<p>which gives a surprisingly complex function! I had assume it would be some simple function of x but clearly something more complex is going on.</p>
<p>Why this happens become clear if you plot out why M urinals are needed for N people. Optimally each person would be separated by 1 urinal, but as the number of urinals increases they become less efficiently packed, with 2 urinals (neither of which can be used without standing next to someone) between each urinating person. This eventually reaches a breaking point and the number of urinals necessary jumps upward.</p>
<p>The formula is known as ‘The Pay Phone Packing Sequence’ (where users of pay phones don’t want to be overheard) and is summarised at <a href="https://oeis.org/A185456" class="uri">https://oeis.org/A185456</a> (where packing occurs/ n &gt; 2). The formula itself is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f(n) = n + 2 ^ {(1 + floor(log(n - 2)))}\]</span></p>
<p>That’s all for this weeks riddler.</p>
