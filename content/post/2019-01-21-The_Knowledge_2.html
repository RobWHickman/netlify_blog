<p>Every so often a question on The Guardian’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theknowledge">The Knowledge</a> football trivia section piques my interest and is amenable to analysis using R. Previously, I looked at <a href="http://www.robert-hickman.eu/post/the-knowledge-4th-august-2018/">club name suffixes and young World Cup winners</a> last August. This week (give or take), a question posed on twitter caught my attention:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

<a href="https://twitter.com/TheKnowledge_GU?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"><span class="citation">@TheKnowledge_GU</span></a> was just chatting to some colleagues in the kitchen at work about why Essex doesn't have many big football clubs and it got me thinking. If you combined all the points from every league team in the ceremonial counties in England, which county would be on top?

<p>The easiest way to get a total of points is using the engsoccerdata:: packages database of every English football match from the top four divisions (this does not include data from the 2017-2018, or 2018-2019 seasons). We can work out the points easily from the goals scored for each team</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#load the data

                 variable.name = &quot;location&quot;,
                 value.name = &quot;team&quot;) %&gt;%

<p>The 388k (194k matches) data.frame seems daunting, but actually only results in many fewer unique teams that have played at least one match in the top 4 divisions in England</p>
<pre class="r"><code>length(unique(match_data$team_subbed))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 141</code></pre>
<p>The location of each club can then be found using the wikipedia pages for them/their stadia. This matches 121 of the 141 clubs pretty nicely which is a fairly good percentage all things considered</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#find the links to each clubs wikipedia page
wiki &lt;- read_html(&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_football_clubs_in_England&quot;) %&gt;%

<pre><code>## [1] 121</code></pre>
<p>We can find the location of these matching clubs by finding the page for their stadia and then finding the coordinates. It’s a bit of a messy function because I was just jamming stuff together to get data out as best as possible. This takes ~1 minute to run through all 121 teams (for the blog post I actually saved an RDS of the output from this and load it just to save time/server calls)</p>

<p>Given it was a Saturday morning where I had nothing better to do, I simply located these clubs home grounds manually and created a data.frame for their locations. It’s not really great practice but whatever.</p>
<p>These are then all bound together and converted to an sf spatial object with the correct projection</p>

<p>Now that we have all the teams, we need the English historical county boundaries to group them by. I’d actually already used these for football analysis, looknig at <a href="https://www.citymetric.com/horizons/football-could-independent-yorkshire-win-world-cup-3961">if an independent Yorkshire could win the World Cup</a>.</p>
<p>Load the data (the boundary file can be download from the <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/boundaryline.html">Ordnance Survey</a>) and make a quick plot of the boundaries and teams</p>
<p>(I also created an sf object engwal which is just the counties from England and Wales selected out for background plotting)</p>
<pre><code>## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
## Source: &quot;C:\Users\Alaa\Desktop\geo_data\boundary\Data\Supplementary_Ceremonial&quot;, layer: &quot;Boundary-line-ceremonial-counties_region&quot;

## It has 2 fields</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>#load the boundary file

                    layer = &quot;county_boundaries&quot;) %&gt;%

  .[c(1:54, 88, 90),]</code></pre>

<p>(by the way the artifacts around Bristol and the Wirral are from the OS dataset- it’s very annoying)</p>
<p>Then we need to determine which teams are within which counties. The easiest way to do this is to use a spatial join of the team names in all_locations by which county they fall into (using st_contains from the sf package)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#bind the team names to each county
counties %&lt;&gt;%
  st_join(., all_locations, join = st_contains) %&gt;%
  #remove counties that contain zero teams
  filter(!is.na(team)) %&gt;%
  mutate(county = as.character(county))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## although coordinates are longitude/latitude, st_contains assumes that they are planar</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>#quick plot of number of teams per county (missing = 0)
counties %&gt;%
  group_by(county) %&gt;%
  summarise(n_clubs = n()) %&gt;%
  ggplot(data = .) +
  geom_sf(data = engwal) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = n_clubs), colour = &quot;black&quot;) +

<p>Which shows that most English historic counties (and a few Welsh ones due to teams like Cardiff City/ Swansea City etc.) have at least 1 team that has competed in the top 4 flights of English football at some point (those that do not are: Isle of Wight, Rutland, Surrey, Warwickshire, West Sussex and Cornwall).</p>
<p>To finally get the total number of points won by these teams, the county data needs to be joined back onto the match data from the top. First I clean it up a bit then make the left_join by team name. Finally the number of points per match is calculated using case_when and points are grouped by county and summed</p>
<pre class="r"><code>county_match_data &lt;- match_data %&gt;% 
  mutate(team = team_subbed) %&gt;%
  select(-team_subbed) %&gt;%
  left_join(., counties, by = &quot;team&quot;) %&gt;%
  mutate(points = case_when(
    location == &quot;home&quot; &amp; hgoal &gt; vgoal ~ 3,
    location == &quot;visitor&quot; &amp; vgoal &gt; hgoal ~ 3,
    location == &quot;home&quot; &amp; hgoal &lt; vgoal ~ 0,
    location == &quot;visitor&quot; &amp; vgoal &lt; hgoal ~ 0,
    hgoal == vgoal ~ 1
  ))

county_points &lt;- county_match_data %&gt;%
  group_by(county) %&gt;%
  summarise(total_points = sum(points))</code></pre>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the county with the most points is Greater London, with Greater Manchester following and other footballing hotspots/ large counties in the West Midlands, Lancashire and around Yorkshire in the trailing group</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(arrange(county_points, -total_points))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 2
##   county             total_points

<p>Which shows just how dominant London has been in the top division of English football (especially as it is only competitive at lower levels).</p>
<p>I had wanted to weight points by the average ELO of that league and see which county has the most weight-adjusted points but got bored for this small blog post.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
