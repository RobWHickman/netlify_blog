Everytuesday, the #Rstats community work on a shared dataset to practice munging and plotting data. Inspired by [Georgios Karamanis](https://github.com/gkaramanis/tidytuesday), I wrote a quick script to store the code I use per run and create animations, in the hope they may be useful to people. 

This page shows the results of quick ~1 hour attacks on data to get something worthwhile out.
