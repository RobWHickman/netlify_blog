When I have a free afternoon, I enjoy answering the questions listed on The Guardian's [The Knowledge](https://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theknowledge) blog. This munging generally ends up as [blogposts](http://www.robert-hickman.eu/post/).

Here are the current examples I have published:

# [August 2018](http://www.robert-hickman.eu/post/the-knowledge-4th-august-2018/)

Looked at successive runs of fixtures for English clubs against identical suffix/prefixes. Also scraped FIFA World Cup squads and looked at players who played in a lower shirt number than their age.

# [January 2019](http://www.robert-hickman.eu/post/counties_league_points/)

# [Febuary 2019](http://www.robert-hickman.eu/post/the-knowledge-7th-february-2019/)

# [June 2019](http://www.robert-hickman.eu/post/guardian_knowledge_june/)

For these questions I tend to rely on the [engsoccerdata](https://github.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata) package in R, to which I am a frequent contributor. I also tend to do a fair bit of web scraping using simple (and sometimes [not so simple](http://www.robert-hickman.eu/post/dynamic_web_scraping/)) methods.
