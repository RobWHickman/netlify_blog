In August 2019, I won the oppurtunity to present a research talk at the inagural [Statsbomb football analytics conference](https://statsbomb.com/conference/). My proposal focused on [Markov models](https://karun.in/blog/expected-threat.html) of possession value when playing football, and incorporating a risk factor into these models.

I presented a 25 minute talk on my work at the conference in October 2019. Below is a list of resources related to the project.

# White Paper

currently in the process of writing up a white paper based on the research. Will upload here when completed.

# R Package

alongside the white paper, I am putting together an R package to easily reproduce the findings, and also extend into other similar models of possession value. The code can be found [on Github](https://github.com/RobWHickman/EPV)
